            Pack your patience: millions of people visit Yosemite from April through October. Yosemite Valley is the main destination for most visitors but there are many places to go in the park.
            Early birds avoid traffic! From spring through fall, arrive in the park before or after peak hours (before 9 am and after 5 pm) to avoid delays and traffic congestion.
            Plan ahead: Due to current health guidelines, reservations are required to drive into Yosemite until October 31, as well as for lodging, camping, and backpacking.
            Keep wildlife wild: do not approach or feed animals.
            responsibly: observe posted speed limits and use pullouts to take pictures and let other cars pass.
            Protect Yosemite’s bears: always practice proper food storage and follow speed limits.
            Staying connected: cellular service is limited. Don’t be surprised if you can’t receive calls or texts in the park.
            How can you help four million people? Learn how to visit Yosemite in a way that is fun, memorable, and safe.
