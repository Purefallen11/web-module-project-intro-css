            <h2>Top Things to Know</h2>
            <b>Pack your patience:</b> millions of people visit Yosemite from April through October. Yosemite Valley is the main destination for most visitors but there are many places to go in the park.<br>
            <b>Early birds avoid traffic!</b> From spring through fall, arrive in the park before or after peak hours (before 9 am and after 5 pm) to avoid delays and traffic congestion.<br>
            <b>Plan ahead:</b> Due to current health guidelines, reservations are required to drive into Yosemite until October 31, as well as for lodging, camping, and backpacking.<br>
            <b>Keep wildlife wild:</b> do not approach or feed animals.<br>
            <b>responsibly:</b> observe posted speed limits and use pullouts to take pictures and let other cars pass.<br>
            <b>Protect Yosemite’s bears:</b> always practice proper food storage and follow speed limits.<br>
            <b>Staying connected:</b> cellular service is limited. Don’t be surprised if you can’t receive calls or texts in the park.<br>
